# Building the Single Purpose Application

## The Task

Build a single purpose application similar to [this one](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo).

Particularly fulfill the following user stories:

- it is possible to see whether FreeCodeCamp is streaming on Twitch;
- it is possible to forward users toward the Twitch stream by way of clicking on the listed stream;
- it is possible to see additional information if the stream is currently ongoing;
- it is possible to search through the listed streams.

Useful links:

- FreeCodeCamp [forum suggestions](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/freecodecamp-challenge-guide-how-to-use-the-twitchtv-api/19541) on the API call.
